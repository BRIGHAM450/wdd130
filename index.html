            Hello! My name is Samir Huertas and I am from Barranca, Peru. I am currently studying Software Development
            at BYU.
            I am passionate about technology and love learning how software can solve real-world problems.
            In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, listening to music, and improving my coding skills.
            I also love helping others and believe in always being kind and respectful.
            I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my faith plays an important role in my
            daily life.
            I’m excited to keep learning and growing as a developer and as a person.
         </p>
