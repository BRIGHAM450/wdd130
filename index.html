         Hello! My name is Samir Huertas and I am from Barranca, Peru. I am currently studying Software Development at BYU.
         I am passionate about technology and love learning how software can solve real-world problems.
         In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, listening to music, and improving my coding skills.
         I also love helping others and believe in always being kind and respectful.
         I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my faith plays an important role in my daily life.
         I’m excited to keep learning and growing as a developer and as a person.
